Variables:
Xn = if vertex n is in the induced subgraph
Ynm = if edge (n, m) is in the induced subgraph

Objective function:
maximize sum(Ynm * Wnm)

Constraints:
Ynm = Ymn for all (n, m) in edges => if edge (n, m) is in the induced subgraph, edge (m, n) is also in the induced subgraph
Ynm >= Xn + Xm - 1 for all (n, m) in edges => if both vertices are in the induced subgraph, the edge is also in the induced subgraph

# since the 2nd constraint is >=, it could choose all positive edges, without choosing any vertex or just one of the 2, so these constraints are needed to correct it

Ynm <= Xn for all (n, m) in edges => limits Ynm to be 0 if vertex n is not in the induced subgraph
Ynm <= Xm for all (n, m) in edges => limits Ynm to be 0 if vertex m is not in the induced subgraph

Xn is binary
Ynm is continuous

The graph is given in the file passed as argument, with the edges and their weights.
